## Kicking off

Hey! Thank you for taking time to check out my website! I plan on posting certification reviews, CTF writeups, homelab updates, projects, personal research and more! At the time of writing, I am about to graduate with my bachelor’s at the University of South Florida. This website was created to showcase my experience and what I have been working on behind the scenes. After all, everything can’t be a LinkedIn post lol. I plan to update the site every couple of weeks, so stay tuned!
